Program Summary:

		For this project, I was tasked with creating a banking app for Airgead Banking. They wanted an app that could allow users to see how their investments would grow over time. 
	
		The app takes the following factors into account when calculating the effects of an investment:
				* Initial Investment Amount: The starting amount of an investment.
				* Monthly Deposit: The amount the user plans to contribute to the growth of an investment.
				* Annual Interest (Compounded): Interest that is added to the principal sum of an investment and its previously accumulated interest.
				* Number of Years: The number of years an investment has to grow.
		
		When tasked with calculating the beginning and end value of an investment, the program will display each of these factors in a "Display Menu" to the user.
	
		The user can then continue inputting various potential monthly deposit amounts to see how the investment will grow until they exit the program.

Programming Strengths:

		When writing out the code for this project, one thing I did well would be getting the calculations correct to output the proper beginning and end balances. 
		I also named my variables so that you could tell what each one represents without taking away from the overall "flow" of the code.

Ways I could enhance my code:

		One way that I could enhance my code would be to get more creative with my display menu. I struggled with properly formatting the various rows and columns of the display menu, which in turn made formatting the asteriks (*) and dashes (-) even harder. I feel that if I were to make the display meny more aesthetically pleasing then the user would be able to read through the menu options more efficiently.

Challenges Faced:

		Throughout this project, I only really struggled with properly declaring the types of variables I was using. For example, I initially had variables like "totalAmount" and "monthlyDeposit" declared as doubles, but after running into various issues and consulting the textbook, I decided to change them to float variables instead. This made it so the user could only enter realistic numbers into the system. 

How this project can be applied to other projects:

		This project can be applied to other projects/future coursework in various ways. One way is how this project heavily utilized display menus. Display menus can be beneficial to all sorts of CS projects as they make both input and output options easier to read. This project taught me a lot on how you can get creative with a display menu while also making it functional.

How is this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable:

		When writing the code for this project, I made sure to include in-line comments to describe what each statement was doing, which makes the code more readable for future programmers. The code is also both maintainable and adaptable as it is properly split up to show what each section does.
